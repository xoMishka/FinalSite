                <h1>About Me</h1>
                <p>Hello World! My name is Amber and I'm a student at Weber State University
                    working on my degree in Web Development, Full Stack Emphasis. I currently live
                    in Dallas, Texas. I am 31 years old,
                    and I have a cat named Winston Churchill, Church for short, named after the zombie cat
                    from Pet Sematary. I also have a dog named Bubba Gump Shrimp, Bubba for short, who is an
                    Anatolian Shepherd x Great Pyrenees mix. Reading is my favorite thing to do with my time!
                    My favorite author is Stephen King and my favorite book is .... I really can't name just one!
                    If I had to, I would say The Stand by Stephen King and Game of Thrones by George R.R. Martin.
                    Anything else you would like to know, feel free to ask!
